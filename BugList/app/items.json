This bug applies to the Bugzilla installation at Mozilla.org. \nJan, I believe you are the person who is in charge of customising Bugzilla, so\nI've assigned this straight to you... apologies if I am off-base here!)\n\nI think that we should endeavour to remove REMIND and LATER from Bugzilla. I\nbelieve that they achieve more harm than good.\n\nThere are many disadvantages:\n\n(a) They can easily not be found by queries. They are, after all, _unresolved_,\n    even though they are marked as RESOLVED/LATER or RESOLVED/REMIND.\n    This is a serious problem, as there are frequently new bugs being reported\n    that are feature requests that have in fact been marked LATER or REMIND\n    but which a quick scan of bugzilla did not find, since the default query\n    does not include the LATER and REMIND resolutions.\n(b) Reopening them results in comments/activity which clutter the bug report.\n(c) They are often set by Netscape employees and hence imply Netscape's \n    agenda for what will go in.  Mozilla, at least, is a open project, where \n    anyone can contribute.\n(d) It is difficult to tell exactly when the REMIND and LATER bugs will in fact \n    be reopened.\n\nSo, what's the alternative?  The obvious answer is: the milestone.\n\nRemind can already be handled by moving the bugs to a later milestone where\nthey need to get reevaluated.

This means that there is\ncurrently no plan for implementation, but it has been considered, and hence\nwon't appear on groups' new bugs radar. So the milestones would go M1, M2, ... \nM29, M30, LATER.\n\nThis, combined  with the introduction of assigning to \"nobody@mozilla.org\", as \nwell as the \"helpwanted\" keyword and the \"Severity: Enhanced\" setting, covers \nall the issues of which I am aware.\n\nThis would require a little modification of queries by Netscape employees to\nexclude untargetted bug reports, but they generally know how to use Bugzilla,\nso it would take them little time to adapt. I think it is more important to \nmake Bugzilla newbies more productive, and thus reduce the load on everyone.\n\nSo in summary: I suggest we remove the LATER and REMIND resolutions, and replace\nthem with a \"LATER\" milestone and a \"remind\" keyword.\n\n[cc'ing the people involved in bug 13534]", "blocked": [], "dependson": [66459, 83129], "assigned": "Dawn Endico", "reporter": "Hixie (not reading bugmail)", "duplicates": []}

{"id": 30942, "desc": "(Note: I present some presumptions here as facts.  Unless I totally blow \nsomething, please respond with non-flames.)\n\n\nThere have been many (exploitable) infinite loop bugs in mozilla, and their \nrate of appearance doesn't seem to be slowing down much.  Several involve \nlayout: a reflow moves something down, which forces it to be moved back up, \nwhich forces it to be moved down again, etc.  Some involve javascript: perhaps \nthere's a while(1) loop in the code.  Some involve history and page reloading.\n\nMost of the time, the layout-related problems are fixed by reviewing the math \nthat determines what happens when, leading to a fix specific to one type of \ninfinite loop.  But HTML is complicated, and I doubt the layout engine will \never be safe from all types infinite loop attacks.\n\nA better solution to this problem would be to add code in strategic places, \nsuch as reflow iterations, that force the browser to check if any user input \n(such as an attempt to close the browser) would make continuing the \ninfinite/slow reflow moot.\n\nIn order to keep allow users to continue noticing reflow bugs (since they won't \nhave to ctrl-alt-del the browser anymore), something should be added to the \nstatusbar to make mozilla show when the browser is:\n\n(1) idle\n(2) waiting for the server to send (more) information\n(3) waiting for user to respond to a modal dialog\n(4) doing a normal reflow\n(5) doing an incremental reflow\n(6) executing javascript\n(7) loading additional dlls or an external application\n\nI propose that the spinning/moving bar on the left side of the statusbar be \nreplaced or supplemented by a small box that changes color to indicate what the \nbrowser is doing.  Release versions might use fewer colors, perhaps light blue \nfor 2 and 3, and dark blue for 4-7.  (This idea is based on a similar box in \nthe dos game Civilization, which would switch between light grey and dark grey \nas the AI players went through various move phases and would get stuck on a \nspecific color if a crash occurred.)\n\nUsers should quickly figure out that the browser is busy while the box/bar is a \ndarker color because they won't be able to scroll, so they should still report \ninfinite-reflow and similar bugs when they encounter them.\n\n\nSome examples of bugs relating to infinite loops:\nhttp://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=20283,24195,26618,30030,30830\n\nBug #20283  a href=\"javascript:history.go(0)\"\nBug #24195  infinite reflow after adding content to scrollable frame\nBug #26618  infinite reflow in addressing ... more than one recipient\nBug #30030  infinite loop if pressing \"back\" leads to javascript redirect\nBug #30830  infinite loop in javascript code freezes mozilla\n\nSome examples of slow (but not infinite) iteration problems:\nhttp://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=17325,30091\n\nBug #17325  too many reflows on slashdot pages (with a fast connection)\nBug #30091  \"select\" form elements cause too many reflows", "blocked": [384323], "dependson": [308158, 13350, 31041, 40848, 62778, 73272], "assigned": "Unassigned", "reporter": "Jesse Ruderman", "duplicates": [98087, 128666, 150593]}

{"id": 19221, "desc": "* Overview:\nThe potential confusion reported in bug 10000 no longer seems possible,\nbut a fix applied to the \"Open Web Location\" dialog to address that\nconfusion is causing usablility problems.\n\nSince bug 10000 was opened, the \"Open Web Location\" dialogs\n(a) no longer appear on the Taskbar, (b) and have been made modal.\n(c) When the parent of that dialog re-appears, so does the dialog.\nPoints (a) and (c) emulate the very useable behaviour in\nCommunicator 4.7; point (b) causes usability problems.\n\nIn the situation described by bug 10000's reporter, the Communicator 4.7\nbehaviour seems entirely sensible and adequate, for File>Open Web Location\nand File>Open File, and the current Mozilla behaviour seems profoundly broken\nfrom a UE perspective.\n\n* Steps to Reproduce:\nIn Communicator 4.7 on all Win32:\n1. User starts Communicator, the browser appears.\n2. User causes another browser window to appear.\n3. User causes Messenger to appear.\n4. User brings up File>Open Page dialog in first browser.\n   Nothing is added to the taskbar at this point.\n5. User switches to second browser window, does anything.\n6. User switches to Messenger windows, does anything.\n7. User switches back to first window. The \"Open Web Location\"\n   dialog is displayed on top, right where the user left it.\n\nIn Mozilla 1999-11-16-08-M12 on WinNT (likely all Win32):\n1. User starts Mozilla, the browser appears.\n2. User causes another browser window to appear.\n3. User causes Mail window to appear.\n4. User brings up File>Open Web Location dialog in first browser.\n   *Nothing is added to the taskbar at this point.*\n5. User switches to second browser window, tries to do anything,\n   but the UI is entirely unresponsive. Any and all windows seem\n   frozen, giving the appearnce that Mozilla as a whole is frozen,\n   so long as the user manages not to return to the first window.\n6. User switches to Messenger windows, tries to do anything,\n   at which point the entire App crashes, killing all windows.\n7. (Reached if step 6 is skipped) User switches back to first window.\n   The \"Open Web Location\" dialog is displayed on top, right\n   where the user left it. Actually, the dialog appears first,\n   then the window under it.\n\n* Expected results:\nMozilla should act like Communicator 4.7 - All windows remain usable,\nand the \"Open\" (or any other) dialog reappears in context when its\nparent is given focus. The current behaviour matches this except for\nthe modality of the dialog.\n\n* Actual Results:\nIf an \"Open Web Location\" dialog is left hanging, it is possible to\nswitch to other Mozilla windows, but nothing can be done in them\nuntil the dialog is used or dismissed. All windows appear frozen,\nand effectively are until the \"Open Web Location\" dialog is used\nor dismissed. (Currently, if the first window is clicked on it\nwill incorrectly get a highlighted Title Bar, despite being\nblocked, making the UE worse yet, but that's a different bug\n- reported already, IIRC)\n\n* Suggested Fix:\nBack out the modality added to the \"Open Web Location\" dialog.\n\n* Tested with:\n1999-11-16-08-M12 nightly binary on Windows NT 4.0sp3\nCommunicator 4.7 on same OS.\n\n* Additional Information:\nHere's what I think that a naive user would want in general terms:\nA. If a browsing/compositor/mail-news/whatever main window\n   is given focus by taskbar selection, ALT-TABbing, Task\n   Manager selection, or any other means, once it appears\n   on top, it should signal any dialog window it may be\n   waiting on to display itself on the very top of the window\n   stack.\nB. If a dialog windows that a main window is waiting on is\n   given focus, it should first signal its parent to display\n   itself at the top of the window stack before diaplaying\n   itself at the top.\nC. No blockage of the UI in other windows no matter what\n   one window is waiting for.\n\nCommunicator 4.7, possibly earlier versions as well, does A.\n\nB. may never in fact be needed. The only dialog I can think of that\nCommunicator places on the Taskbar (and task list) where it\ncan be independently reached is the \"Saving Location\" Dialog\n(the one after the \"Save Page As\" dialog), which has effectively\nbeen cast off - neither the parent window nor the child need to\nkeep tabs on one another. If it is needed, it should get split\noff as a new bug report, and the practical problems of dialogs\nknowing and notifying their parents noted in bug 10000 will be apropos.\n\nSome earlier versions of Communicator and previous netscape browsers\ndid not meet expectation C.", "blocked": [25824, 26981, 28594], "dependson": [8877, 65521], "assigned": "Dan M", "reporter": "Sean Richardson", "duplicates": [15574]}

Bug 516224 is also related.]\n\nWhen SeaMonkey encounters a cookie, it opens a dialog box that has three buttons for options: Allow, Allow for session, and Deny. There is also a button for details on the cookie, and an option to \"use my choice for all cookies from this site [the site that is the source of the cookies, not necessarily the site hosting the page on which the cookie is found]\"\n\nThe \"Allow/Allow for session/Deny\" buttons on the cookie dialog box are right-aligned, and the dialog box expands to accommodate the length of the URL of the cookie site. However, if I am about to click on \"Deny\" for a site with a normal-size URL, and at that instant another cookie dialog box pops up with a very long URL, the \"allow\" button on the new dialog box is in the same location as the \"deny\" button of the box from which it stole focus. As a result, instead of denying one cookie, I allow another one.\n\n\nThree possible ways to deal with this:\n1. Fix the width of cookie dialog boxes and allow the contents to scroll horizontally, so that the buttons are always in the same place.\n\n2. Centre-align the buttons so that they are always in a consistent location, no matter the width of the dialog box.\n\n3. However, neither of the above deals with the problem of one cookie approval dialog stealing focus right as you're about to click another one. Usually this isn't a problem for me because I choose the same decision for all cookies on a page, but conceivably it can be a problem. The third option is to grey out the options for half a second or so before allowing the click to register (as with saving add-ons); however, this adds a further problem, as with Bug 516224, when there are many cookies to be processed on a single page it can take a very long time to resolve all the cookies on a page. This may not be a problem if my suggestion on that bug for an option to \"apply this decision to all cookies on this page\".\n\nReproducible: Always", "blocked": [], "dependson": [], "assigned": "Unassigned", "reporter": "realgrouchy", "duplicates": []}

{"id": 74053, "desc": "This is a reminder bug, serving notice that the true problem underlying a \ncouple of other bugs, now closed, still remains.\n  The Windows OS chooses a surprising window to activate once a stack of \ndependent (or modal, in our case) windows has been closed. That is, if a \ndependent and or modal window itself opens another window, once both those \nwindows are (made active and) closed, you might expect the grandparent that \noriginally opened the dependent window would be made active. But in fact it's \njust about the only window that won't be activated. This confuses users, \nespecially in Composer which stacks dialogs like this with relish. That's bug \n22658.\n  I checked in a fix for this. That fix activates the parent window at an \nunexpected point, causing focus to be confused. That was a raft of other bugs, \nlike bug 54936.\n  The fix for bug 22658 fired too often; it has since been restricted to just \ndialogs which we noticed opened another child window. That causes bug 22658 to \nregress occasionally (for certain child windows that we don't detect properly, \nlike the filepicker) but not for, for instance, Composer's dialogs stacks. This \nrestriction apparently fixes most if not all of the focus problems, happening in \nstacks of just one dialog as they were.\n  I've closed the bugs mentioned above, since technically they've been fixed.

You should assume the OS has returned a font with a size of\n'x'px. The background should have a height of exactly 'x'px. Anything with a\nsize of 1em should have a size of exactly 'x'px.\n\nQuick example:\n   if SPAN { font-size: 50px; background: yellow; padding: 0; border: none; }\n  and IMG  { height: 1em; }\n then the height of an image in the SPAN should be *exactly* 50px, and the\n      background of the SPAN should be *exactly* 50px high too. Any text in\n      the SPAN should have a nominal height of 50px, but this DOES NOT mean\n      that the distance between the bottom of the lowest glyph to the top of\n      the highest glyph will necessarily be exactly 50px, it may be a\n      considerably bigger or smaller value. *This means glyphs may well spill\n      out from the background*. [1]\n\nThe actual fonts may quite possibly spill into surrounding boxes, lines, text,\nand so forth (assuming 'overflow' is set to 'visible', anyway).\n\nAn example of probably correct rendering of the first case listed above,\n   http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/fonts/sizes/\n...is Opera's rendering of the page:\n   http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/fonts/sizes/opera\n...(at least, assuming it is using the correct font-size).\n\nWhatever you do, make sure you don't cause a regression in:\n   http://www.bath.ac.uk/%7Epy8ieh/internet/eviltests/lineheight1.html\n   http://www.bath.ac.uk/%7Epy8ieh/internet/eviltests/lineheight2.html\n   http://www.bath.ac.uk/%7Epy8ieh/internet/eviltests/lineheight3.html\n\n([1] To prevent glyphs from spilling out of the background, a web designer would\n use the padding properties. To prevent glyphs from flowing into surrounding\n _lines_, the web designer would use the 'line-height' property.

{"id": 970152, "desc": "We spend a non-trivial amount of time hashing extremely long strings in order\nto put them in hash tables. A while back jlebar had an idea about only hashing\npart of such strings. I don't think anything came of it at the time, but I just\ntried it out and it appears to be worthwhile.\n\nConsider SunSpider. During its execution, we call HashKnownLength() 509,192\ntimes. The average string size (in bytes) is 12.8, but there's a long tail. The\nfollowing table shows what fraction of the bytes processed by HashKnownLength()\nis done for strings of varying lengths.\n\n0+      6551978     100%\n10+     6128982     93.5%\n100+    2046114     31.2%\n1000+   1646374     25.1%\n10000+  1414048     21.6%\n100000+ 1201432     18.3%\n\nI.e. 21.6% of the work is done for strings of size 10,000+, and 18.3% of the\nwork is done for strings of size 100,000+. The longest string is 600,112 bytes.\nVery long strings are rare, but because they are so big, they account for a\nsignificant fraction of the hashing effort.\n\nI did the same measurements for a few minutes of browing at techcrunch.com,\nnytimes.com, and bbc.co.uk. We hashed 5,505,563 strings, with an average string\nsize of 14.5 bytes, and the longest string was 96,710 bytes.\n\n0+      79580839    100%\n10+     76318870    95.9%\n100+    15336229    19.3%\n1000+    9961271    12.5%\n10000+   8274210    10.4%\n\nSo if we, say, limited ourselves to just hashing the first 999 bytes, we'd do\n25.1% less hashing in SunSpider, and 12.5% less in vanilla browsing.\n\nThe hashing mostly comes from SpiderMonkey, where we atomize every identifier\nand string that appears in user code; long strings in user code appear to be\nthe major source of very long strings.\n\nBTW, HashUntilZero() gets used much less than HashKnownLength() -- e.g. it's\nnot used at all by SpiderMonkey.", "blocked": [], "dependson": [], "assigned": "Nicholas Nethercote [:njn]", "reporter": "Nicholas Nethercote [:njn]", "duplicates": []}

{"id": 69172, "desc": "This bug was really tricky for me to find so I'll try to be extra careful while \ndescribing it.\n\nI first saw the bug in an JavaScript emulation that emulates a small part of \nthe Internet Explorer DHTML Object Model. To see the bug try \nhttp://webfx.nu/dhtml/ieemu/genmove.ieemu.html and move the layers around \n(using the mouse) for a while (~10 seconds).\n\nAfter a lots of tests I came to the conclusion that all one had to do was add \nan event listener for mouse move and move the mouse A LOT. The less javascript \ncode that is being evaluated the more one has to move the mouse. This makes me \nthink that maybe it is not a bug in the event system but in the javascript \ninterpreter.\n\nThe following code crashes mozilla. Notice that you have to move the mouse for \na while (about a minute or more).\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"mousemove\", function (e) {\n   true;\n}, false);\n\nThe code makes Moz crash if the event listener is using capture as well.\n\nAnother thing that might help to figure out what is going on is to open up the \ntask manager and then you'll see that the memory is leaking when the mouse \nmoves over the document. The first few seconds while the mouse pointer is \nmoving the memory seems to be constant but after a while a few more kb are \nbeing used. If you see this you will get a crash in Mozilla (not directly \nthough). Just continue to move the mouse pointer and after a while every little \nmouse move makes more memory become used by Moz. Finally leading to a crash.\n\nThe crash does not give any error message (Dr. Watson) in Win2k.

Set up the PGO profileserver params in .mozconfig\n2. Build FF4 RC1 with make -f client.mk profiledbuild\n3.

ARM should be straightforward but I don't have a way to test changes to it.  x64 is considerably more complicated, as it depends on signal handlers to be able to execute loads/stores without the bounds checks that x86/ARM require.\n\nIt would be possible on x86 and (presumably) ARM to get things going even faster than they are using these nodes, as bounds checks could be hoisted from the loop and instructions cut from the loads/stores.

Changing the latter bit from >>> 0 to | 0 improves things so that performance is at parity between asm.js and vanilla compilation.  This change is valid to make and is consistent with how other integer operations behave in asm.js.\n\n- This and many other range analysis truncation optimizations only work if the division or shifts have never overflowed while running in baseline.
